# Plutonium
A raytracing rendering engine

This is my attempt to build my own raytracing rendering engine. It is called Plutonium, because you know... Plutonium is radioactive, so it shoots a lot of rays - and so does my renderer.

Resources that went into this project:\
"Raytracing in a Weekend" by Peter Shirley\
"Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" by Steve Marschner and Peter Shirley
